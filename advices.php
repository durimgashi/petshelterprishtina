        <h1><code>Pet Care</code></h1>

        <p>Owning a pet can keep you healthy by boosting your immune system and encouraging you to get regular exercise. And, older people who regularly walk their dogs walk faster and for longer periods, and have better mobility in their homes.</p>

        <p>Growing up with pets may improve children’s social skills and encourages childhood responsibility. Pets can also encourage children to develop compassion, understanding and respect for living things. </p>

        <h1 id="petneeds"><code>Understanding </code></h1>

        <p>Pets can offer us so much, so they deserve our care and respect. Whether you're and experienced cat owner or are thinking of buying a puppy, we all need some advice from time to time.</p>

        <p>Take a look around you you'll discover all you need to know about pet <a href="#pethealth">health</a>,<a href="#pethygiene">hygiene</a>,<a href="#petsupervision">supervision</a> and <a href="#petdiet">diet.</a>And also we have included some <a href="#video">videos</a> about pet care.</p>

        <h1 id="pethealth"><code></code></h1>

        <p id="multicolumn">All pets, including both dogs and cats, require regular veterinary care. However, veterinary care goes far beyond <u>routine vaccinations</u>, even though those are important. A routine examination by your veterinarian can uncover health issues of which you are unaware. In many cases, an early diagnosis improves the chances of successful treatment. Early diagnosis is also likely to be less costly for you than waiting until your pet’s illness has become advanced and serious before attempting treatment.You know your cat or dog needs regular checkups to stay healthy. But how often should he get them?The answer depends on your pet's life stage, says Susan Barrett, DVM, head of community practice at Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine.You'll need to bring your little one in for vaccines every 3 to 4 weeks until he's 16 weeks old.Dogs will get shots for rabies, distemper-parvo, and other diseases. They may also need shots to protect against health woes such as kennel cough, influenza, and Lyme disease.Cats will get tests for feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus. They also get vaccinations that cover several diseases.At this stage, your pet will also start heartworm and flea- and tick-prevention medications, if they’re recommended for your area.The vet will examine your pup or kitten to make sure he's growing well and shows no signs of an illness. She'll check again at around 6 months, when you bring your pet in to be spayed or neutered.</p>

        <h1 id="pethygiene"><code>Keep your pets clean</code></h1>

        <img id="petbrush" src="images/pethyg.png" width="200px" style="float: left">

        <p>Like humans, <a id="petssword">pets</a> can experience skin conditions that may cause redness, itchiness, odor, and even wounds. Fortunately, many skin conditions can be prevented with routine bathing and grooming. Dr. Alison Diesel, clinical assistant professor at the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, explained the importance of pet hygiene for both dogs and cats. A common problem among dogs and cats, dental disease and oral health issues can cause your pet pain, making it difficult for him or her to eat. If left untreated, oral health issues may even lead to heart and kidney disease. In addition to regular dental checkups, the most effective means of caring for your pet’s mouth at home is to brush his or her teeth at home. If your pet isn’t a big fan of toothbrushes there are other alternatives as well, including dental diets, treats, and toys. Ask your veterinarian for some recommendations.On one hand, most cats do not usually require a bath to maintain a healthy skin and coat, Diesel said. However, she added that older or obese cats may benefit from bathing to help keep their coat and skin healthy. On the other hand, dogs require regular bathing and grooming with a frequency that depends on their skin and coat health.</p>

        <p>Allowing your dog or cat to roam free may seem like you’re doing your pet a favor. However, pets that roam are susceptible to a number of dangers, including automobile accidents, predation, exposure to contagious diseases, exposure to poisons, and more. Additionally, allowing your pet to roam unsupervised may alienate your neighbors should your pet ever "relieve" him- or herself in their lawn or dig up their garden.If you are a dog owner and dog lover, you can easily conjure up an image of groups of dogs running freely across a field, fetching sticks or balls, rolling in the grass and playing with one another. In fact, that image probably brings a smile to your face – because, for one thing, you love to see dogs having a good time. But you also probably understand intuitively that off-leash time is a great source of exercise for a well-socialized dog.Generally, larger dogs need more active and sustained exercise than small dogs. The average, young and healthy Golden Retriever will need to run around each day for a good, long time, far more than the average, young and healthy Chihuahua, whose needs may be better satisfied with a few daily, neighborhood strolls. Similarly, younger, healthy dogs need more physical activity than older or geriatric dogs. A good rule of thumb is that most medium-to-large, young and healthy dogs need at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise each day.</p>

        <h1 id="petdiet"><code>Feed a high quality diet</code></h1>
        <img src="images/dogfood.png" width="200" height="200" style="float: left">
        <p>Pets fed a high quality diet have a <u>shiny hair coat, healthy skin, and bright eyes.</u> A good diet can help <u>strengthen your pet’s immune system, help maintain his or her intestinal health, help increase his or her mental acuity, help keep joints and muscles healthy, and much more.</u>When choosing a healthy, high protein diet for your pet, avoid any bags that feature corn or soy as a prominent ingredient (or better yet, avoid them all together). You want named meat meals (like chicken meal or lamb meal) or quality meat as the primary protein source.On the following table we have listed some of the main foods and meals that dogs and cats should be eating regulary,in moderation and foods that they should never eat.</p>
